# Word Guessing - Charades PWA game

https://cuongnmtm.github.io/word-guessing-charades


A charades party game built as a Progressive Web App. Perfect for parties and game nights!



## 💡 Why I Built This


In 2025, I wanted to play charades with my family but couldn't find a **free** mobile app that worked well. Most apps had ads, paywalls, or required constant internet connection.



With **AI coding tools dominating** the tech landscape, I decided to experience it firsthand by building this app **100% with AI assistance**. The result? A fully-featured charades game built in hours, deployed on **GitHub Pages** (completely free), and works **99% offline** thanks to PWA technology.



**No ads. No subscriptions. Just pure family fun.** 🎉

Control the game with your phone's motion sensors! (iOS & Android)

### How to Use:
1. **Flip phone DOWN** (tilt forward) = **CORRECT** ✅
